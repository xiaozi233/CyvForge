# CyvForge
 CyvFabric/CyvClient ported to 1.8.9

Note: I won't be updating this anymore as I quit minecraft parkour. 

Also, this project is meant to be an example to show off modernized MPKMod code and various other parkour features. If you wish to improve its features, please make your own project and feel free to copy my code. Please do not fork off this one.
